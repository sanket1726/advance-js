# OOP's

- Letâ€™s dive into the core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with their definitions, examples, and how they can be applied in JavaScript.
- We'll cover:
    1. Encapsulation
    2. Abstraction
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphism

- I'll also explain each concept with generic pseudo code followed by JavaScript examples.

## Summary of OOP Concepts:

- Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods into a class, and restricting access to certain components.

    - In JavaScript: Achieved using private fields (#) and methods.

- Abstraction: Hiding complexity and exposing only the essential parts.

    - In JavaScript: Implemented using base classes and throwing errors for abstract methods.

- Inheritance: A class (child) inherits properties and methods from another class (parent).

    - In JavaScript: Achieved with the extends keyword.

- Polymorphism: Different objects respond to the same method in their own way.

    - In JavaScript: Implemented using method overriding.
