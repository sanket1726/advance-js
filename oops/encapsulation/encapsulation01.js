/**
 * Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions)

 * It also means restricting direct access to some of an objectâ€™s components
 * and only exposing what is necessary.

/**
 * Generic Pseudo Code:
class Person {
    private age: int;
    public setAge(age: int): void {
        this.age = age;
    }
    public getAge(): int {
        return this.age;

}
 * The age property is private and can only be accessed through setAge and getAge methods.

/**
 * JavaScript Example:
 * In JavaScript, encapsulation can be achieved using closures or private fields (introduced in ES6+).
 * The #age property is private, ensuring that it is not directly accessible from outside the class.
