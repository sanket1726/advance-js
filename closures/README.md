# Closures

## Key Takeaways:
- Closure with let, var, and const: Understanding how closures handle state or variables in different scoping contexts (let, var, const) is key, especially in React components.

- Closures in Functions: In React, functional components heavily use closures in hooks (useState, useEffect), and understanding how closures work is essential to avoiding bugs (like stale closures).

- Closures in Classes: Similar to functions, closures in class components can encapsulate state or variables, especially in event handlers or lifecycle methods.
