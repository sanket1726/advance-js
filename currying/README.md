# Currying

## Benefits of Currying in Real-World Use Cases:

- Reusability: By pre-configuring functions, you can reuse them across different parts of an application.
- Modularity: Currying encourages splitting complex logic into smaller, composable functions.
- Separation of Concerns: It helps in isolating side effects (e.g., logging, API calls) from the core logic of your code.

## Use of currying in functional programming

### Function Composition

- Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.
- Currying enhances this by allowing functions to be partially applied, which makes it easier to compose and chain functions.

### Partial Application

- Partial application refers to fixing a number of arguments to a function, producing another function that takes the remaining arguments.
- Currying naturally supports partial application, making it easier to build complex functions incrementally.

### Higher-Order Functions

- Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.
- Currying aligns well with higher-order functions by enabling incremental function application.
